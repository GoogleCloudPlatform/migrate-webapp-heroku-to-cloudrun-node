# Sample web app to create tasks

Pre-reqs : See the tutorial that accompanies the code example at
[Migrating Node.js apps from Heroku to Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/migrating-nodejs-apps-from-heroku-to-cloud-run).

This repository contains sample code to create a Tasks app that lets you create
tasks and view existing ones. Created tasks are stored in a backend database,
PostgreSQL is used for this example. The app can be deployed to Heroku and
shows you how you can migrate it to run on the Google Cloud Platform using
Cloud Run and Cloud SQL.
